# Rhythmbox Osdlyrics Plugin

This is a simple plugin that helps you to toggle lyrics display through toolbar button. 
It calls [osdlyrics](https://code.google.com/p/osd-lyrics/) to display lyrics, so osdlyrics is required.

## Introduction

This plugin will create a toolbar button, like this:

You can toggle lyrics display by clicking it.

Besides, it will remember your lyrics state (on/off) every time you quit rhythmbox.

## Install

Use `git clone` to download or simply download as zip file.

Just copy this directory to `~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/` (if not exist, make one).

Then open rhythmbox, enable it in plugin manager dialog.

_PS: you may want to disable the original lyrics plugin as well._
